## 🔍 Why the Threat Score Was Flagged as High Risk

SolidityScan flagged a 32.5/100 threat score primarily due to **contract ownership privileges**, **token supply concentration**, and **standard ERC-20 architecture** decisions. Here's our breakdown:

---

### 🔸 1. Owner Wallet Holds 97.9% of Supply
- **Why It Was Flagged:** Centralized control of supply.
- **Explanation:** This is by design during the **pre-ICO phase** to facilitate:
  - Liquidity pool creation
  - Airdrops and reward programs
  - Partner onboarding and exchange listings

✅ **Planned supply decentralization** post-ICO via vesting contracts, liquidity locks, and burns.

---

### 🔸 2. Mint and Burn Functions Present
- **Why It Was Flagged:** Risk of uncontrolled inflation/deflation.
- **Explanation:** These functions are:
  - **Restricted to the owner only**
  - Required for tokenomics execution (e.g., supply control, rewards)

✅ All mint/burn actions are visible on-chain. We use them transparently.

---

### 🔸 3. Pausable Contract Feature
- **Why It Was Flagged:** Potential for trade suspension.
- **Explanation:** The pause feature exists **only for emergency use** (e.g. bug mitigation, upgrade protection).

✅ Not used to interfere with normal trading. Never activated post-deployment.

---

### 🔸 4. ERC-20 Approve Race Condition
- **Why It Was Flagged:** Common ERC-20 vulnerability.
- **Explanation:** This is a **known limitation of the ERC-20 standard**, not a unique flaw in our code. 

✅ Users are encouraged to `approve(0)` before changing allowances.

---

### 🔸 5. No Proxy-Based Upgradeability
- **Why It Was Flagged:** Contract not upgradable.
- **Explanation:** We opted for **immutability** to guarantee:
  - Full auditability
  - Simpler architecture
  - No behind-the-scenes changes post-deployment

✅ Builds trust through static, verified code.

---

## ✅ Final Notes
- The contract is **verified on PolygonScan**.
- All trading actions (buy, sell, transfer) passed simulation.
- No honeypot or scam behaviors detected.
- Token has 0% buy/sell tax and is gas-efficient.
